# Natrual-Language-Processing-model
In this project, I am using a training data set that contains 500000 records of Yelp reviews of businesses (such as restaurants, home services, auto services, etc.). The reviews in the training are labeled as positive, negative or neutral. I will build a multi-class classifier based on the training data.
