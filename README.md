# Natrual-Language-Processing-model
In this project, I am using a training data set that contains Yelp reviews of businesses (such as restaurants, home services, auto services, etc.). The reviews in the training are labeled as positive, negative or neutral. I will build a multi-class classifier based on the training data. The data sets to be used in this project were taken from the Yelp Open Dataset (https://www.yelp.com/dataset), which contains millions of online reviews. <br>
For this project, 56,000 reviews were randomly selected to form a training set and another 14,000 reviews were selected as testing data. Both are stored in csv files. Each row in the training data set contain a review in text, its class label (positive, negative or neutral) and the id of the review (which you should ignore when learning a classifier). In the test data set, each row contains the id and text of a review. <br>
